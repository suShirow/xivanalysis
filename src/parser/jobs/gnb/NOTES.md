# GNB Feature Suggestions

## Ammo
- [ ] Check for bad Burst Strikes - (i.e. when at 1 ammo + Bloodfest is on CD + Gnashing is off CD)
- [ ] Check for uses of Fated Circle on a single target
- [ ] Fix bug where uncomboed Solid Barrel counts toward Cartridge generation (requires infrastructure work in combo detection)
- [ ] Log waste by source somewhere in output, including Death/End of fight as a waste source

## Continuation
- [ ] Add checks for if the next Continuation was even usable before the fight ended - if not, don't penalize
- [ ] Consider keeping track of missed Continuations and logging them in a collapsed Rotation table

## No Mercy
- [ ] Show Danger Zone instead of Blasting Zone if we detect that the combatant is sub-80 (e.g., there is a Danger Zone used instead of a Blasting Zone)

## OGCDDowntime
- [ ] Figure out how charge systems work (requires infrastructure work)
