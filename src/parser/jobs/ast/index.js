Playing any healer requires you to carefully manage your MP and cooldowns to efficiently keep your party alive. If you plan out your heals and communicate with your co-healer, you will naturally end up putting out more DPS with the extra GCDs gained.

This tool displays the usual uptime and gcd recommendations. It also gives a simple print-out for buffs you've extended and the card actions you've made.

				Currently, for all healers, boss invulnerability checking doesn't function properly. This results in inaccuracy for many time-related functions such as the Always be casting checklist item or DoT uptime.
